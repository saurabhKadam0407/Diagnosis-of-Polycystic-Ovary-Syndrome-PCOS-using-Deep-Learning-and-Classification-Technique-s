# Diagnosis-of-Polycystic-Ovary-Syndrome-PCOS-using-Deep-Learning-and-Classification-Technique-s

Abstract-

 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder which affects women worldwide. One can know whether she is affected by PCOS that is it is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, high blood pressure, obesity, fatigueness, etc. Timely Diagnosis of PCOS is very crucial for effectively managing and preventing associated complications. The advancements in artificial intelligence shows promise in diagnosis of medical tasks. In this paper we propose a novel approach for diagnosis of PCOS using deep learning & classification techniques. We provide analysis of various machine learning algorithms like svm, na√Øve Bayes, random forest and decision tree & deep neural network architecture for identification of PCOS based on clinical and biochemical features. Our results are mostly useful for the medical experts which helps them by reducing the diagnostic delays caused thereby providing an improved patient care and management.

Keywords: Polycystic ovary syndrome, deep learning, classification techniques, healthcare, PCOS diagnosis.


Scope -
-Machine learning algorithms are applied to a dataset comprising clinical features of patients.
-The aim is to create precise diagnostic tools for detecting Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).
-Identify PCOS-related problems and address issues associated with PCOS.
-We have used K-NN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, CNN, and SVM to implement this model.
-These tools enable medical practitioners and individuals to proactively
-Decrease potential long-term health risks linked to PCOS. Improve early detection and management of the disorder


Objectives -
-Develop a decision tree model based on the Random Forest approach to identify the most influential attributes in PCOS diagnosis.
-Demonstrate the significance of early PCOS detection in mitigating associated health risks, such as cardiovascular diseases and obesity.
-Empower both medical professionals and individuals by providing a user-friendly tool for self-assessment and monitoring of PCOS-related indicators.
-Showcase the potential of machine learning techniques to revolutionize PCOS diagnosis and management, leading to improved patient outcomes.
